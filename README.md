A parametric white dwarf asteroseismology code for rapid model testing.

Built with numerical precision in mind.

## Operating Systems
THRAIN will only build on macos and linux, explicitly on ubuntu.  It cannot be built on windows, due to reliance on posix-only i/o functions.  Science uses unix.  Consider taking the plunge.
